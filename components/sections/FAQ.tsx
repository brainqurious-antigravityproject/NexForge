    id: '1',
    question: 'Do I need to be a large business to work with you?',
    answer: 'Not at all. We work with small and medium-sized Indian businesses — local service providers, manufacturers, exporters, and D2C brands. Whether you need a simple ₹12,000 showcase website on Wix Studio or a ₹60,000+ custom Next.js build with chatbot, we have an option for your budget and your platform.',
    category: 'process'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    question: 'Which platform should I choose — WordPress, Shopify, Wix, or custom?',
    answer: 'It depends entirely on what your business needs. WordPress is best for SEO-driven content sites and service businesses. Shopify is best for online stores and D2C brands selling products. Wix Studio is best for fast, editable business websites with a lower budget. Custom Next.js is best when you need maximum performance, custom features, or AEO and GEO-first structure. We recommend the right platform after understanding your goals — not based on which one earns us more.',
    category: 'process'
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    question: 'Can you add an AI chatbot to my existing website?',
    answer: 'Yes. If your website is on WordPress, Shopify, Wix, or is a custom-coded site, we can add a chatbot that answers your visitor queries in Hindi, Hinglish, or English — trained on your product details, pricing, and FAQs. It captures leads even at 2am when your team is offline.',
    category: 'tech'
  },
  {
    id: '4',
    question: 'What are SEO, AEO, and GEO — and do I need all three?',
    answer: 'SEO (Search Engine Optimization) helps your website rank in Google and Bing search results. AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) helps AI tools like Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and voice assistants cite your business as a direct answer. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) helps large language models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot mention and recommend your business when users ask for suggestions. All three matter because search behaviour is splitting across these three channels. We build AEO and GEO-ready structure into every website we deliver — schema markup, Q&A content, clear entity signals, and fast Core Web Vitals.',
    category: 'tech'
  },
  {
    id: '5',
    question: 'I need product images but do not have a photographer. What can you do?',
    answer: 'We can generate studio-quality product images and website banners using AI — from just your raw product photographs. We have generated 400+ images for home furnishing, fabric, and consumer product brands. Pricing is per-batch and significantly cheaper than a studio photoshoot.',
    category: 'tech'
  },
  {
    id: '6',
    question: 'How much does a website cost?',
    answer: 'Wix Studio websites start from ₹10,000. WordPress websites start from ₹12,000. Shopify stores start from ₹18,000. Custom Next.js websites start from ₹22,000. Add-ons like AI chatbot start from ₹12,000 and AI image generation from ₹5,000 per batch. All prices are fixed and quoted upfront — no surprises, no GST added on top.',
    category: 'pricing'
  },
  {
    id: '7',
    question: 'Who will I be communicating with during the project?',
    answer: 'Directly with our team — the people building your website. There is no account manager or middleman. You can reach us on WhatsApp, email, or call. Most project updates happen on WhatsApp because that is what works best for Indian clients.',
    category: 'process'
  },
  {
    id: '8',
    question: 'What if I need changes after the website launches?',
    answer: 'Two weeks of post-launch support is included in every project at no extra cost — regardless of platform. After that, we are available for changes on an hourly or per-task basis. Maintenance retainer packages are also available if you need ongoing updates, content changes, or security management.',
